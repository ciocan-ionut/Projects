This project was made during high school\
The idea came from my desire for a simple app where I can check my school schedule, so I wouldn't have to rely on a photo from my gallery\
It was developed for personal use, and since I own an Android phone, I didn't put effort into making it work on iOS\
I built the app using Xamarin.Forms, with C# for the back-end, based on knowledge that I gained in high school, and XAML for the front-end, which I learned while working on the project
