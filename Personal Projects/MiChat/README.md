This project was made during summer vacation between my first and second year of university\
I was inspired by a little project that was shown by our professor during a lecture on Qt and Observer pattern and decided to expand that idea and make a fully fledged application\
I built the application in C++ with Qt and it provided a very good learning opportunity on how to manage a database, a client-server connection and how to make the back-end efficiently communicate with the front-end
